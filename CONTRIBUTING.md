# Contributing

Thanks for considering helping this project.  There are many
ways you can help: using the library and reporting bugs,
reporting usability issues, making additions and improvements
to the library, documentation and finding security bugs.

## Reporting bugs

Please file a github issue.  Include as much information as
possible.

## Code changes

Some ideas and guidelines for contributions:

- For large features, file an issue prior to starting work.
  This means everyone can see what is in progress prior to a PR.
- Feel free to submit a PR even if the work is not totally finished,
  for feedback or to hand-over.
- Prefer not to reference github issue or PR numbers in commits.
- Try to keep code formatting commits separate from functional commits.
- See [`.github/workflows/test.yml`](.github/workflows/test.yml) for how to run the various 
  test suites.
